# Product Team Governance

Circle Parent: https://www.notion.so/Product-7d3424b27bd942c6be4819143748c48f

## Policy

- The primary repository for Product team governance resides here: [https://github.com/ParabolInc/Governance](https://github.com/ParabolInc/Governance)
- Proposals are treated as Pull Requests. An example proposal is here: [https://github.com/ParabolInc/Governance/pull/1/files](https://github.com/ParabolInc/Governance/pull/1/files)

### Mirroring

This change will be treated in a manner similar to how we treat [codebase deprications](https://www.notion.so/parabol/Codebase-Deprecation-63a86b951a484a24a3d829643410abae):

- Roles and Policies will continue to reside in Notion until a revision (i.e. new governance) is proposed
- When a new version is created, a mirrored version will be kept in Notion as well with the content embedded either as duplicated markdown or an embedded page
