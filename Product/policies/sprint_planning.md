Purpose: Reduce idle time spent in meeting
---
Tension: As the product team grows, the cost of a 1 hour planning meeting grows. Every meeting should be worth the time invested.

I propose replacing the current 1 hour meeting with a 30-minute pre-work meeting & a 30-minute planning meeting.

The pre-work meeting can be any time before the planning meeting.

The PM is the only mandatory attendee. A member of the product team and/or one stakeholder who could accelerate the planning process is allowed. 

The agenda for the pre-work meeting is to:

- Prioritize the backlog
- Create issues that currently don't exist
- Tentatively assigning items to team members

The planning meeting is reserved for the following:

- Seeking consent for general direction
- Seeking consent for the tasks assigned to developers
- Adjusting the acceptance criteria to make sure the assignee is clear on what is to be delivered
