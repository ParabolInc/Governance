Purpose: to set up our development sprints to focus on the most important work
---

Sprint planning happens before a sprint officially begins. It is divided into two 30-minute meetings:

   1. A "pre-work" meeting with limited attendence
   2. A "planning meeting" the whole Product team may attend


## Pre-work meeting

### Attendees

- All L4 and above Product team members

### Agenda

The agenda for the pre-work meeting is to:

- Complete any late-breaking prioritization of Inbox issues to the Backlog
- Re-prioritize the Backlog according to the current strategy
- Draft the sprint by moving over the top Backlog items to the Inbox, taking care to:
   - Include any `p1` bugs
   - Add the most important issues from active epics
   - Create any issues to fill gaps in our development plan
   - Find and prioritize any low-effort bugs related to areas of active development
   - Aim to hit about 80% of our team's capacity to complete the items within the sprint

## Planning meeting

### Attendees

- All Product team members

### Agenda

The planning meeting is to:

- Seek consent for prioritized items:
   - Answer clarifying questions on sprint goals
   - Hear reactions on sprint goals
   - Make amendments (i.e. changing the items included in the sprint)
   - Ask for objections
- Answer clarifying questions on acceptance criteria for specific issues
- Adjust the acceptance criteria for specific issues
